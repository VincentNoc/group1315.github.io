As technology becomes more and more advanced there will be new developments in many industries. I believe the biggest impact on an industry technology will have, will be on the medical industry, and more specifically artificial body parts and organs. There are many negatives to artificial body parts and organs, however I believe that the positives will outweigh the negatives. The reason why is because of the purpose of artificial body parts, it is to help people who have lost a limb or organ through sickness, trauma or a condition at birth,  it will give them a second chance or a chance to live a “normal” life.
<br><br>

The significance of this technology is evident through the numerous opportunities it presents. From improving the quality of life for handicap and the elderly, to also lessening the demand for transplant organs. The technology will pave the way for improved quality of life for many people who will need it. 
<br><br>

Though there are many positives when it comes to the development of artificial body parts and organs, there are still many risks that come with it, from the perception of it,  the health and safety, security and human augmentation. The perception of artificial body parts and organs, can become a problem if people start looking at people with these prostheses as objects, this can create problems like treating someone unjustly and giving that person inhumane work environments, this could become very dangerous for people who rely on these devices because this could create a lot more violent cases with people with artificial body parts and organs who  are the victims. What I recommend so these problems don’t arise is to educate the young, to implement classes at primary schools teaching what people with prosthetics go through and what there prostheses is used for, and for high school they could arrange assemblies talking about this, this could help educate our future generation on what artificial body parts and organs are, and will raise awareness for what handicap people go through.
<br><br>

For health and safety there is always going to be risk when involved, the process of implementing the artificial body part into the human body is always dangerous due to there being a chance of it being rejected by the immune system, and the only way for better results is to test the technology even more, what I recommend is for the developers of this technology to inform and ask for the consent of the person they are going to work on and to repeat this over every new stage of testing they get to, so that the patient doesn’t need to worry or be confused on what is going to be done to them. 
<br><br>

Also with the advancement of technology bionic arms to starting to have access to the cloud, so improving the security of the bionic arm is a must, this will prevent people with malicious intent to hack into the bionic arm, I think the best thing for rehabilitation developers to do is for them to team up cyber security vendors so that they can create a more robust and complex security system that will prevent any malicious hacking attempts to happen. 
<br><br>

The final risk that I am most worried about is human augmentation, the reason why I am worried about it is because if we get to a point where human augmentation is the “norm” even on abled body people, this could create the perception of people without out augmentations are inferior, this could also lead to a bigger rift in classes, meaning that the rich can buy the best augmentations, while the poor either have none or a augmentation that is far inferior to what the rich use. I believe this could create higher tension between the classes, and could cause chaos and could end very badly for both sides. To avoid this I recommend that the government  must put in rules and regulations of what the augmentations can have, and only make them available for people who are in need of them.
<br><br>

Though there are many negatives, I still believe that the positives still outweigh the negatives. The problems that may arise from artificial body parts and organs can be easily avoided by educating ourselves on what artificial body parts and organs are, and how we could treat people with them. With this in mind I believe if we are able to educate ourselves, we can focus more on the improvement of this technology and improving the quality of life for handicap people and the elderly
