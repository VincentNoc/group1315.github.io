    I believe the impact of technology on medical care, in terms of artificial body parts and bionic people, has a very positive effect. Although there are ethical issues regarding the conceptualization of people with artificial body parts being seen as objects, health and safety risks, distribution of justice concerns and human augmentation, I still think there are more positives than negatives. The use of artificial body parts allows people, who were born without a body part or have experienced having to lose a limb, to function like everyone else. Artificial limbs can improve the ability for disabled people to manage day to day activities as it helps them mobilize, allowing them to be more independent and not having to rely on someone to help them do natural human things. 
 <br><br>

Although it is unethical for people to objectify people with prosthetics, without it they would still be looked at as different as they would be missing a body part. Having an artificial body part and having the risk of people potentially looking at you as an object is better than having nothing. I personally recommend teaching kids at a young age that it is normal for people to have prosthetics, and not to judge them. In terms of health and safety, it may be unethical doing clinical tests on multiple people over years or even decades as it is creating human guinea pigs and at times, dangerous if the procedures go wrong. However, if the people being tested are there on their own free will, it shouldn't matter if it is ethical or not, especially if the use of these artificial body parts and organs have the potential to save lives. I believe it should be up to the patients if they want to contribute or not and shouldnâ€™t be seen as unethical. Distribution of justice raises a lot of ethical questions. For example, will everyone have a moral right to get an artificial limb or organ? or will only people who can afford it get one? This can be unfair and unjust. I personally believe everyone who was born without a body part or has lost a body part, deserves the right to have a prosthetic for free, if they want it, as it is not their fault, and they deserve to function like everyone else. Also, if someone needs an artificial organ, they should be given one without question or cost as it is life threatening. The ethical issues around human augmentation is that in the future artificial organs and body parts perform better than our natural body and it becomes the new norm to have bionic people around. This is a huge possibility and needs to be researched more by professionals. However, I believe if this were to happen, it can change the way our bodies are today into robots and will definitely raise a lot more issues. For example, the age in which these procedures would occur, if this was to be as soon as they were born or at an age where they can't make decisions for themselves then that will be an issue. I recommend we eliminate the threat before it happens. We should only give prosthetics to the people who actually need it and not go beyond that. However, if there is a chance that artificial organs can perform better than in the natural state of organs and allow us to live longer, then why not? We are not in the stage where this is possible yet and I personally feel like we need to look into this more.
 <br><br>

The positives of artificial body parts and organs outweigh the negatives. The ethical issues surrounding this topic can be easily removed with a little change to the way we think and act. I believe the potential of using artificial body parts and organs in medical care has the potentially to help change lives of the unfortunate and in certain circumstances save lives.
