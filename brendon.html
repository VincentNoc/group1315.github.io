   Industrial robots, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, these are classified as a emerging technology. They are advancing at a rapid pace and improving the speed, quality, and cost of goods and services of our life. While the public is focusing on these futuristic matters of technology, the impact of technology in healthcare, especially on prosthesis, as known as, ‘artificial body parts’, is slowly attracting its presence to its audience.<br><br>

 The main reason for its importance comes from substitutability, it helps to overcome sickness, trauma or a condition at birth by replacing missing or damaged limbs or organs. It gives hope and another opportunity to the people. On the other hand, experts, who are opposed to the prosthesis emphasize its risk and issue, which causes serious problems to the user. However, despite the fact that it is dangerous, it has a bright future in the medical technology industry and also solving its problems that are holding back its potential.<br><br>

 The major ethical problem with prosthesis is that the use of artificial body parts could lead people to view a person with prosthesis as a machine-like object rather than a human being. The possibility of a body part or organ being replaced could lead to the perception that human body parts are replaceable objects. It could be abused everywhere and people could use them every time when they feel unwell or unpleasant with their organs or body parts. It is a dangerous idea, since the human body cannot be replaced fully and even though a person finds a prosthesis that fits, it is not going to be as well-functioning as the original organs or limbs. This harmful thought may devalue the human body itself. Also a person with an artificial body part could feel different than everyone else. It may be hard for the people with artificial body parts to accept the fact that they have to rely on a device to function properly and could lead to a low self-esteem or they could be treated differently in a workplace or school. Low self esteem could affect their behaviour and this could lead to their attitude at any social situation and discrimination of prosthesis could lead to a mental illness. Humans functioning with an artificial organ or body part for the rest of their life can be very dangerous and unpredictable. the implants may malfunction, be rejected by the immune system or could be hacked by attackers. It is a sensitive matter and ethically wrong, where they lose their rights, just because they are using prosthesis.
  <br><br>

Ultimately, there is no perfect substitute for a human body and yes, it is a fatal weakness to leave users in a serious danger, however, the security and compatibility with the human body is improving rapidly and since it has a great potential in the industry, many leading companies in cyber securities and medical engineering are working together to break through this situation. "It is now of crucial importance for the developers of such technologies to collaborate with cybersecurity solution vendors. That will allow us to make even theoretical cases of attacks on the human body impossible." (Chekh, 2019). The fact that it can partly substitute the missing limbs and organs may seem insignificant to the healthy person. However, to the person, who desperately needs it, it may come to them as a only hope and could lead to new life opportunities. It has lots of obstacles to overcome, but I am hoping one day, prosthesis could be a great substitute for missing or damaged body parts and not see them as an object, but a neighbour, who is the same as us.<br><br>
